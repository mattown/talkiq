#  Description
#
#

This simple etl script will take a target directory and search for any .txt files in it, it will produce a sorted word count
of unique words in the files, as well as unique counts for each file


It also assumes that there is an optional file named stopwords.txt in the same runtime directory and all this is is a list of specific words
to filter out


To run the script run the following

    $ python3 etl.py <target directory>

This will produce 2 files

    feature1.txt --> this has a sorted word count of unique words found in the target directory (excluding words found in stopwords.txt)
    feature2.txt --> total unique word count by file (excluding words found in stopwords.txt
